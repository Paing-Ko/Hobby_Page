# Hobby_Page
My first project is to create a Hobby Page for Founders And Coders Portfolio.
I built a web page about one of my hobbies, coding.
The page is built with HTML, styled with CSS and use a bit of JavaScript.

## Features
_The page has a title which informs the user what the site is about
_The page has a logical layout and clear structure
_There are images on the page, withalt-textwhere appropriate
_The page is visually interesting, for example with borders or colours
_A list is visible somewhere on the page
_A user can click on a link that takes them to another website (freeCodeCamp)
_The page has a header element, and a footer element.
_Somewhere on the page, the user can see today’s date. The date should always be correct. 
You’ll need to use JavaScript to generate the date, 
and DOM manipulation to display it.
